# vimrc
- colors have been picked up from [rainglow vim repo](https://github.com/rainglow/vim) and the vimrc itself has been built on top of the one from [the vim lecture from the missing semester MIT course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/).
- Features that I have added
    - mapping normal mode to *kj*
    - auto-completion of brackets and quotes
    - commenting using *,cc* and uncomment using *,cu*(doesn't always work)
    - auto-indent added and default tab size is 4
